# Toolcrib

Tools are expensive and easy to lose track of. Please number then and record their history as they get used here.

Record who bought them, for how much, where from, catalogue number and any feeds and speeds information provided by the supplier. We want to make sure that when we find a tool we like, we can get it again.

You must use the correct collet size and tighten it firmly. Do not use the 3.125mm collet for 3mm tools or you will need to get it out with a hammer and chisel.

RPM[rev/min] = Vc[m/min] * 1000/60/(3.14 * tooldia) * 60
Feedrate = RPM * fz * numflutes
